                   Script can't be launched from elsewhere than powershell
                   Poor security



To use this script : 

This script only works when launched from PowerShell

Let's assume that the script is in the desktop folder.

cd .\desktop\
python3 ytdl.py


Then when the GUI opens. Just put the video's URL and click "Download"

The video you've downloaded will be in the same folder as the script itself
